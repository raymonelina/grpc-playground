# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a gRPC bidirectional streaming playground that demonstrates real-time ad serving with context refinement. The system consists of clients and servers implemented in Java, C++, and Rust that communicate using a bidirectional streaming protocol. The client sends context information in two phases, and the server responds with progressively refined ad lists, simulating a real-world scenario where initial results are improved as more context becomes available.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement gRPC bidirectional streaming clients in multiple languages, so that I can demonstrate cross-language interoperability and streaming communication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client opens a bidirectional stream THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the AdsService GetAds method
2. WHEN the client sends the first Context message THEN the system SHALL include query, asin_id, and empty understanding fields
3. WHEN 50 milliseconds pass after the first message THEN the client SHALL send a second Context message with filled understanding field
4. WHEN the client sends the second Context message THEN the client SHALL call onCompleted to half-close its side of the stream
5. WHEN the client receives AdsList messages THEN the system SHALL buffer them by version number
6. WHEN multiple AdsList messages are received THEN the client SHALL replace older versions with newer ones based on version field
7. WHEN the client waits for a random timeout (30-120ms jittered) THEN the system SHALL return the most recent AdsList as the final result
8. WHEN the interaction completes THEN the client SHALL log whether an AdsList was received and which version was selected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement gRPC bidirectional streaming servers in multiple languages, so that I can provide ad serving functionality that improves results over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a server receives the first Context message THEN the system SHALL generate and send AdsList with version=1
2. WHEN a server receives the second Context message THEN the system SHALL generate and send AdsList with version=2 using the complete context
3. WHEN 50 milliseconds pass after the second Context THEN the server SHALL send a third AdsList with version=3
4. WHEN the server sends the third AdsList THEN the server SHALL call onCompleted to close the response stream
5. WHEN generating ads THEN the system SHALL create 5-10 mock ads with asin_id, ad_id, and score fields
6. WHEN using context for ad generation THEN the system SHALL incorporate query, asin_id, and understanding fields into the scoring logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all client and server implementations to be interoperable across Java, C++, and Rust, so that I can demonstrate language-agnostic gRPC communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any client connects to any server THEN the system SHALL successfully establish bidirectional streaming
2. WHEN cross-language communication occurs THEN the system SHALL exchange exactly 2 Context messages and 3 AdsList messages
3. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL maintain proper protobuf serialization/deserialization
4. WHEN the interaction completes THEN the system SHALL gracefully shutdown without dangling streams
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL surface them properly and respect deadlines

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-defined protocol buffer schema, so that all implementations can communicate using the same message format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the protocol THEN the system SHALL use proto3 syntax
2. WHEN defining Context message THEN the system SHALL include query, asin_id, and understanding string fields
3. WHEN defining Ad message THEN the system SHALL include asin_id, ad_id string fields and score double field
4. WHEN defining AdsList message THEN the system SHALL include repeated Ad field and version uint32 field
5. WHEN defining AdsService THEN the system SHALL include GetAds method with stream Context input and stream AdsList output

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build and execution scripts, so that I can easily generate code, build, and test all implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL create language-specific stubs from the proto file
2. WHEN building projects THEN the system SHALL compile all Java, C++, and Rust implementations
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute interoperability tests between all client-server combinations
4. WHEN testing completes THEN the system SHALL verify message counts, version ordering, and final result selection
5. WHEN scripts are provided THEN developers SHALL be able to run the entire system with simple commands
